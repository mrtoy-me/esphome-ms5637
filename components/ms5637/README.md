## Usage: MS5637 component
Copy component's files to a ***components*** directory under your homeassistant's esphome directory.<BR>
The following yaml can then be used so ESPHome accesses the component files:
```
external_components:
  - source: components
```
The component uses the sensor's default i2c address of 0x76.<BR>

## Example Basic Configuartion YAML
```
sensor:
  - platform: ms5637
    pressure:
      name: MS5637 Pressure
```
## Configuration variables:

- **pressure** (*Required*): The information to setup the pressure sensor.

  - **name** (**Required**): The name for the pressure sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from Esphome Sensor configuration.

- **temperature** (*Optional*): The information to setup the temperature sensor.

  - **name** (**Required**, string): The name for the temperature sensor.
  - **id** (*Optional*): Set the ID of this sensor for use in lambdas.
  - All other options from Esphome Sensor configuration.

- **resolution** (*Optional*): Set sensor sampling resolution. In summary, resolution impacts 
  the adc conversion time (1-17ms), sensor current draw (0.6-20uA) and reading resolution (0.1-0.02mbar).
  Given the sensor error band is typically +/- 2mbar, the component's default resolution should meet
  the requirements of most applications. For more details on resolution, refer to the datasheet.<BR>
  ``OSR_256``, ``OSR_512``, ``OSR_1024``, ``OSR_2048``, ``OSR_4096``, ``OSR_8192``. Defaults to ``OSR_2048``.

- **address** (*Optional*): Manually specify the IÂ²C address of
  the sensor. Defaults to ``0x76``.

- **update_interval** (*Optional*): The interval to check the
  sensor. Defaults to ``60s``.


## Example Advanced Configuration YAML
```
sensor:
  - platform: ms5637
    resolution: OSR_2048
    pressure:
      name: MS5637 Pressure
    temperature:
      name: MS5637 Temperature
    address: 0x76
    update_interval: 60s
```
